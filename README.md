I'm currently working on building up my GitHub profile with data science projects.
I'm leaming the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Prediction (Regression). Prediction (Classification). Cluster analysis
(Unclassified data) and Advanced data science (Deep Learning).
I'm looking to collaborate on any of the presented data-science projects or open to other projects.
I'm looking for help with front end applications, ideally displaying the data-science results on a website.
Ask me anything data-science related, and I'l be happy to help you out. I love talking about this!
Pronouns: He/His.
